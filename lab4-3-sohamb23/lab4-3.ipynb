    "Natural language quantifiers can be thought of as expressing a _relationship between two properties_. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Recall that a _property_ can be thought of as a set of objects (those bearing the property) or a function from objects to truth values (which takes those objects that bear the property to _true_ and objects not bearing the property to _false_). In our flight world, $Flight$ is a property, as is $\\lambda x. Origin(x, Boston)$ (\"objects originating in Boston\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language quantifiers like \"every\" express a relationship between two properties, the _restriction_ of the quantifier and the _scope_ of the quantifier. For instance, in the sentence \"every flight leaves from Boston\", the restriction property is expressed by  \"flight\" and the scope property is expressed by \"leaves from Boston\". The relationship that \"every\" expresses is simply that _everything bearing the first property also bears the second property_. Similarly, \"some\" expresses the relationship that _there is something bearing the first property that also bears the second property_. And \"most\" expresses that _most (at least half, say) of the objects bearing the first property bear the second property_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of thinking about quantifiers as expressing relationships between two properties is referred to as [_generalized quantifiers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_quantifier), because it generalizes the FOL notion of quantifier by adding an explicit and separate restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In FOL, quantifiers $\\forall$ and $\\exists$ have only a scope and not a restriction. When we write $\\forall x. \\ldots$, the $\\ldots$ is the scope of the quantifier; we can think of this as expressing that $\\forall$ holds of the single property $\\lambda x. \\ldots$. How then can restriction properties be expressed in FOL? By folding them into the scope.\n",
    ">    * \"every flight leaves from Boston\": $\\forall x. Flight(x) \\Longrightarrow Origin(x, Boston)$\n",
    ">    * \"some flight leaves from Boston\": $\\exists x. Flight(x) \\land Origin(x, Boston)$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Notice though that in incorporating the restriction ($Flight(x)$) into the scope of the FOL quantifier, we use different ways of combining them depending on the quantifier. That's somewhat inelegant. More importantly, for most NL quantifiers, _there is no way of encoding the relationship between restriction and scope with just a single property_, as we happen to be able to for the universal and existential quantifiers. Hence, semanticists have moved to the generalized quantifier approach to quantifier meanings, as we do here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow for meanings for the first order quantifiers, we'll define some Python functions that capture this generalized quantifier approach. Each quantifier function takes the two properties, restriction and scope, and returns a truth value."

    "This type of ambiguity is referred to as _quantifier scope ambiguity_, and appears almost inevitably when a sentence has multiple quantified noun phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Other scope-taking elements can also give rise to scope ambiguities. For instance, modals (like \"may\", \"must\", \"can\"), and negation (\"not\") also have scope and can engender ambiguities. For instance, the sentence \"you may not go\" arguably has two readings, paraphrasable as \"you have permission to not go\" (that is, you may stay) and \"you do not have permission to go\" (that is, you must stay). Examining these further kinds of ambiguity is beyond the scope (so to speak) of this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see that both representations have the same components, just structured differently. The different ordering possibilities of the quantifiers is what generates the ambiguity. In representation (1), $\\forall x$ has the outer scope, while in representation (2), $\\exists y$ has the outer scope. Reflecting this ordering, the two readings are sometimes referred to as the *AE reading* and the *EA reading*, respectively.\n",
