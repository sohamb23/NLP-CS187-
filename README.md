# NLP-CS187-
Large Projects and smaller lab projects that I worked on through an NLP-focused class in Fall 2021
Used mainly PyTorch for all of the projects.

All Large Projects were applied to the ATIS Dataset
- project1-sohamb23 was focused on text classification through Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and a Multilayer Perceptron
- project2-sohamb23 was focused on sequence labeling using HMM, RNN, and LSTM frameworks
- project3-sohamb23 was focused on implementing the CKY Parsing algorithm for context-free grammars and probabilistic context-free grammars
- project4-sohamb23 was focused on semantic interpreatation to convert natural language into an SQL query using a rule-based approach and an end-to-end sequence approach

Smaller lab projects were focused on various topics that were meant to prepare for the larger projects
- Tokenization, tf-idf, BoW
- Classification techniques(Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Techniques to do sequence labeling(RNN, HMM)
- Context-free grammars and parsing
- Rule-based systems, semantics
