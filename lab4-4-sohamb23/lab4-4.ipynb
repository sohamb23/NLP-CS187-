    "We can use any recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs as encoders and decoders. In this lab, we will use a bidirectional LSTM as the encoder, and a unidirectional LSTM as the decoder, as shown in the illustration below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/nlp-course/data/raw/master/img/encoder_decoder.png\" alt=\"encoder-decoder illustration\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above illustration, $S=4$, $T=3$, and there are two encoder/decoder layers. Since we are using a bidirectional encoder, for each layer there are two final states, one for the cell running from left to right (such as $h_{0,4}$), and the other for the cell running from right to left (such as $h_{0,4}'$). We concatenate these two states and use the result to initialize the corresponding layer of the decoder. (In the example, we concatenate $h_{0,4}$ and $h_{0,4}'$ to initialize layer 0, and we concatenate $h_{1,4}$ and $h_{1,4}'$ to initialize layer 1.) Therefore, to make the sizes match, we set the hidden state size of the encoder to be half of that of the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in PyTorch's LSTM implementation, the final hidden state is represented as a tuple `(h, c)` ([documentation here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html)), so we want to apply the same operations to `c` to initialize the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll implement `forward_encoder` and `forward_decoder` in the code below. The `forward_encoder` function will be reminiscent of a sequence model from labs 2-* and project segment 2. It operates on a batch of source examples and proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Map the input words to some word embeddings. You'll notice that the embedding size is an argument to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optionally \"pack\" the sequences to save some computation using `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence`, imported above as `pack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the encoder RNN (a bidirectional LSTM) over the batch, generating a batch of output states.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reshape the final state information (which will have `h` and `c` components each of half the size needed to initialize the decoder) so that it is appropriate to initialize the decoder with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward_decoder` function takes the reshaped encoder final state information and the ground truth target sequences and returns logits (unnormalized log probs) for each target word. (These are ready to be converted to probability distributions via a softmax.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in decoding are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Map the target words to word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the decoder RNN (a unidirectional LSTM) over the batch, initializing the hidden units from the encoder final states, generating a batch of output states.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Map the RNN outputs to vectors of vocabulary size (so that they could be softmaxed into a distribution over the vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "The components that you'll be plugging together to do all this are already established in the `__init__` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The major exception is the reshaping of the encoder output `h` and `c` to form the decoder input `h` and `c`. **This is the trickiest part.** As usual, your best strategy is to keep careful track of the shapes of each input and output of a layer or operation. We recommend that you try out just the reshaping code on small sample data to test it out before running any encodings or decodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** The total number of `for` loops in our solution code for the parts you are to write is...zero.\n",

    "## Beam search decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search decoding is the most commonly used decoding method in sequence-to-sequence approaches. Like greedy decoding, it uses a left-to-right search process. But instead of only keeping the single argmax at each position, beam search maintains the $K$ best partial hypotheses $H_t = \\{(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}): k\\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}\\}$ at every step $t$. To proceed to $t+1$, we compute the scores of sequences  $y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}, y_{t+1}$ for every possible extension $y_{t+1}\\in \\mathcal{V}$ and every possible prefix $(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}) \\in H_t$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ is the vocabulary. Among these $K\\times |\\mathcal{V}|$ sequences, we only keep the top $K$ sequences with the best partial scores, and that becomes $H_{t+1} = \\{(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_{t+1}^{(k)}): k\\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}\\}$. To start at $t=1$, $H_1 = \\{(y): y \\in \\text{K-argmax}_{y_1\\in\\mathcal{V}} \\log P(y_1|y_0=bos) \\}$. Here $K$ is called the beam size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "H_1 &= \\{(y): y \\in \\operatorname*{K-argmax}_{y_1\\in\\mathcal{V}} \\log P(y_1|y_0=bos) \\}\\\\\n",
    "H_{t+1} &= \\operatorname*{K-argmax}\\limits_{\\{(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{t+1})\\in \\mathcal{V}^{t+1}: (y_1, \\ldots, y_t) \\in H_t \\}} \\log P(y_1, \\ldots, y_{t+1} | x)\n",

    "until we reach a pre-specified maximum search length, and we collect the completed hypotheses along the way. (By completed we mean ending with `<eos>`.) The finished hypothesis with the best score will then be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Is beam search better than greedy search when $K=1$? Is it better when $K>1$? Why? How big a $K$ value do we need to get a guarantee that we can find the globally best sequence (assuming a maximum sequence length $T$ and vocabulary size $|\\mathcal{V}|$).\n",

    "Under the probabilistic formulation of sequence-to-sequence models, the partial scores are decomposable over time steps: $\\log {\\Pr}_\\theta(y_1, \\ldots, y_T \\mid x) = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\log {\\Pr}_\\theta(y_t \\mid y_{<t}, x)$. Therefore, we can save computation in the above process by maintaining the partial sums $\\sum_{t'=1}^t \\log {\\Pr}_\\theta(y_{t'}^{(k)} \\mid y_{<t'}^{(k)}, x)$, such that we only need to compute $\\log {\\Pr}_\\theta(y_{t+1} \\mid y_{<t+1}^{(k)})$ when we want to go from $t$ to $t+1$. \n",
